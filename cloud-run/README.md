# Google Cloud Platform (GCP) -  Cloud Run and Artifact Registry Demo

We will use Google Cloud Artifact Registry and Cloud Run for this tutorial. We will create a Python application running in a docker container. The docker image is uploaded to the Artifact Registry on GCP and used to create the Cloud Run Service.
The demo shows the ease with which a containerized workload can be run in Cloud Run.

The files are uploaded for the video demo
